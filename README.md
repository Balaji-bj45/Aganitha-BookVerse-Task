## ✨ Features

*   **Immersive User Interface:** A beautiful, dark-mode-first design featuring an interactive, mouse-aware "aurora" gradient background.
*   **Versatile Search:** Users can search for books by general **Keyword**, specific **Title**, or **Author**.
*   **Dynamic Homepage:** The application greets users with a curated list of "Featured" or "Trending" books, providing immediate engagement.
*   **Advanced Loading States:** Instead of generic spinners, the UI uses sleek **skeleton placeholders** that mimic the final layout, providing a superior loading experience.
*   **Glassmorphism & Depth:** Key UI elements like the header and search bar use a frosted-glass effect (`backdrop-blur`) to create a sense of layering and depth.
*   **Fluid Animations:** Powered by **Framer Motion**, all animations are purposeful and smooth, from page load transitions to satisfying hover effects on book cards.
*   **Informative Book Cards:** Each card displays the book cover, title, author, and rating, with a beautiful hover effect to reveal more details.
*   **Pagination:** Efficiently navigate through thousands of search results.
*   **Fully Responsive:** A mobile-first design that looks and works perfectly on all devices, from small phones to large desktop monitors.
*   **Robust Error Handling:** Clear and user-friendly messages for network errors or when no search results are found.
